        >Henry Taylor and his wife Mary Ellen Taylor moved to Denton in 1895
        from Decatur, where Taylor worked as a cowboy. They settled in the “city
        within a city” of Denton, called Quakertown.Where he cleaned houses and
        gardens for the wealthy white folks on the west side of town Quakertown
        was a thriving black community that was established in 1875 that had
        many successful black-owned businesses and a tight-knit community. After
        purchasing their property from Mary Ellen’s brother, Henry began
        planting many of the throwaways from his job as a gardener in his own
        yard, i ncluding rare white lilacs and a “magnificent” elm tree, and
        soon his yard looked like a beautiful park.</span

        home’s new location.
