This was the first public school in Denton for African American students. Educational opportunities for African American families were very limited, and families migrated from throughout the South, some from as far away as Georgia, to Denton so that their children could attend the school. The original location of the Fred Douglass School was at the intersection of Holt & Terry Street, where it burned down in September 1913.

Prior to becoming an educator, Fred Moore was a talented musician and band leader, and he opened a barbershop on the Square in downtown Denton. Moore was educated at Prairie View College, and did graduate work at Columbia University in New York. He was an influential community leader in Denton; in addition to the Fred Moore School, there is also a park named after him. At the dedication of the school to Fred Moore in 1950, the Superintendent of Denton Public Schools said of Moore: “Professor Fred D. Moore has done much to build a wholesome spirit between the two races in Denton. He has furnished a high class leadership in the field of education as well as in the entire community. He has the respect of his white friends and the admiration of the community.” </span><div class="v77_7818"></div><span class="v77_7819">Portrait of Professor Fred Moore, visible from the chest up.
