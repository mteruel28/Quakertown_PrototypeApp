        Originally married to Emily Weeks in 1878, and having several children
        with her, Joseph Skinner was a long-time resident of Denton. Mrs. Weeks
        passed in June 1913. On Christmas Day of that same year, Joeseph married
        Mrs. Alice Clark and moved to Bell Avenue in Quaker Town. This property
        is where Mr. Skinner ran his shoe shop and repaired some toys for Quaker
        Town residents on the side. The city of Denton evicted and purchased the
        Skinner’s property on July 1922 for only $1,000.00. This forced the
        couple and their children to move to 418 E. Prairie across the tracks
        from Alliance Miling. The street that runs along their property has been
        named Joe Skinner.
